I started with creating my bad-cars.txt containing all cars from many_cars with bad licensenumbers by writing.

.once bad-cars.txt
SELECT LicenseNumber FROM cars WHERE substr(LicenseNumber,1,3) IN (SELECT combo FROM banned);

Now i have a bad-cars.txt containing all bad license numbers from the many_cars list.

Now i want to delete all bad license numbers from the many_cars, i did this by writing.

DELETE FROM CARS WHERE substr(LicenseNumber,1,3) IN (SELECT combo FROM banned);
